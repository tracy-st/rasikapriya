  "description" : "Radha sits back on a large cushion outside her palace. She faces a female companion who stands before her, gesturing. Krishna has just left their company, and is walking into the dense and lush landscape. Various trees line the edge of a river or lake. Swirling white lines represent the waterâ€™s currents, while lotus blossoms decorate the surface. The background features different types of trees, with six tall palm trees and large blooms in the distance. At the top of the painting is a solid yellow block that contains black text written in the Braj language. It states:\r\n\r\nA Sakhi speaks to Radha:\r\nRadha, your name is such that it detects falsehood, expresses love and binds people to you. Everyone knows that it gladdens Kamdev (God of Love), arouses desire, and attracts Krishna. It is an ornament for Mohini and a deterrent for gopis. On hearing it, Krishna has become homeless. Is this just your name or a mantra? (4.18)\r\n\r\n\r\nMohini is the only female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. She is portrayed as an enchantress, who maddens lovers, sometimes leading them to their doom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chhatris (canopies), which are a common feature of Indian architecture, of the palace break into the text space, and even disrupt the lines of text. The painting is surrounded by thick, red borders. Rajput Style.",
